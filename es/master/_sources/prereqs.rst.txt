Prerequisites
=============

This page is a guide to setup and use of CTSM on the norwegian clusters rund by Sigma2. 
To get access to these you need to create an account by filling out this `form. <https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/notur/>`_ 
You will need a project code that you can ask your project manager( ie. supervisor) for. 
Once this form is filled out the project manager and sigma2 will need to approve the application. 
This will take some days, and you're good to go. 

If this is your first time using a remote HPC-system, or you want to know more about Sigma2's setup 
this `tutorial <https://sabryr.github.io/hpc-intro/12-cluster/index.html>`_ is a great place to start.
